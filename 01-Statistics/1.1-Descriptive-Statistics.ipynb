    "Quickly judge data quality (missing values, skew, outliers).\n",

    "Feature selection hints (correlated features, constant features).\n",

    "Understand class imbalance (counts, mode).\n",

    "Interpretability — communicate dataset summary to stakeholders.\n",

    "Examples:\n",
    "\n",
    "If feature has huge variance → scale or normalize for gradient descent.\n",
    "\n",
    "If target is highly skewed → log-transform before regression.\n",
    "\n",
    "If a column has same value for 99% → drop it (no signal)."

    "📊 Measure of Dispersion \n",
    "\n",
    "When we calculate mean, median, or mode, we know the center of the data — where most values lie.\n",
    "But we don’t know how spread out the data is. That’s where measure of dispersion comes in.\n",
    "\n",
    "🧠 Simple Definition:\n",
    "\n",
    "A measure of dispersion tells us how much the data values vary or spread out around the mean (or any central value).\n",
    "\n",
    "🎯 Why it’s important (especially in ML):\n",
    "\n",
    "Helps understand data consistency — whether data points are tightly packed or widely spread.\n",
    "\n",
    "Many ML models (like regression, clustering, anomaly detection) assume certain levels of variance or normal distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "Helps detect outliers or high variability which can affect model accuracy.\n",
    "\n",
    "⚙️ Common Measures of Dispersion:\n",
    "Measure\tMeaning\tUsed For\n",
    "Range\tMax - Min\tQuick idea of spread\n",
    "Variance\tAverage squared deviation from the mean\tUsed heavily in ML (like loss functions)\n",
    "Standard Deviation (SD)\tSquare root of variance\tTells spread in same units as data\n",
    "Interquartile Range (IQR)\tQ3 - Q1\tUsed to detect outliers (Box plots)\n",
    "🧩 Real ML Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "Let’s say we have two models predicting house prices:\n",
    "\n",
    "Model A predictions: [10.1, 10.2, 10.0, 10.3]\n",
    "\n",
    "Model B predictions: [8, 12, 6, 14]\n",
    "\n",
    "Both may have the same mean, but Model A has a smaller dispersion → more stable and reliable predictions."

    "\n",
    "When you train a model, your training data = sample\n",
    "\n",
    "The model should generalize to real-world data = population\n",
    "\n",
